  <div id="Synopsis"
       <p>When thinking about campus food options, it was brought to our attention that we may just not have enough options in general, BUT especially when it comes to students and faculty with dietary restrictions, such as being vegan, vegetarian, gluten free, or having any kind of allergy. NCSU surprisingly provides numerous sources to help students live a healthy lifestyle on campus, but these have been hidden beneath tabs on our website that seem to have virtual spider webs on them. This is where we found the disconnect between what our students believe and the truth behind these sources. I did not even know many of these resources existed until we began our research and several of the pages had not been updated since about 2017. In the process of doing research, we actually reached out to the nutritionist on campus to get some input from her, which seemed to answer just about every one of our questions about the very under-rated campus food services and all of the hard work that is put into them.</p>

  <h1>The Unknown: From a Campus Registered Dietician, Leslie Schatz</h1>

  <!--THIS IS LESLIES INTERVIEW TO GO WITH THE PHOTO OF HER-->
  <p>What does your position entail?

I am the R&D chef on campus and one of the registered dietitians. My primary role is to determine what meals are put into our production system, and determine the foods provided by our different dining options such as our dining halls, fine dining locations, and catering for campus events. NC state actually owns and operates almost all of the facilities on campus. We have over 20 food service operations, all of which are ours with a few exceptions such as Chick-fil-a, Jason’s Deli, Port City Java, and Starbucks. We control everything from recipe ideation, to recipe entry into our production system, to labeling, to working with our outside vendors and their management teams. As a registered dietitian, I also work with my team to label everything, work with students with special dietary restrictions such as food allergies, medical reasons, preference, or religious reasons, etc.


What are some resources that you provide to students to encourage them to make healthy choices?

We offer all campus visitors our Nutrition Guide which features key focuses like our Menus of Change commitments, which is a national program where we help rive menu collaboration that is more sustainable and more plant-forward. We have Dietician’s Dish, which is led by our Dietetic diplomats who provide a daily meal from each dining hall. We have Well-Fed Wolfpack, which is just a generic email, so if anyone has any health or wellness questions, they can ask us there and someone will respond. We have allergy information at every point of contact in the dining halls as well as in the talley pavilions, and that’s all stuff we mark in the system. We also mark foods that are vegetarian, vegan, if it includes pork--which is a relatively new addition--wolf approved, which indicates any dishes that meets certain nutritional criteria, and we have halal, which is something we’re currently working on, but we want to make sure we collaborate with the Muslim Student Association on campus to make sure e’re accurate on that. We have brochures with all of our resources available across campus; they should be available at various front desks, the Talley desk, our office, and we also hand them out at every orientation for people to take if they want. The resources are also detailed on our website. We also offer referrals out to Student Health or Wellness and Recreation as the situation dictates.

How accessible do you think these resources are to students, and how often do you think they use them?

We can track the number of hits on our website to see what people are looking at. I do not supervise that, our web developer Tom does, but we have seen a general uptick in the number of hits on our nutrition informatics and our labelling information. I find the website fairly accessible. I prefer to use the NC State Dining website, but I know some students prefer the On Campus app. When I go on the website, I can select each dining hall to see their specific menu, then select dining preferences to see foods that meet certain requirements, so it automatically hides anything that doesn’t meet my selected material. We have to manually include wolf approved. There are some things not listed on the daily menu, such as our salad bars. Students also have the ability to customize some meals depending on their dietary needs, but we are working on communicating that out.

We pride ourselves on having a pretty wide variety of menu items, but we could do a better job of communicating our menu items. We’ve found that depending on which locations students go to eat, there might not be the options they want, or, if they’re vegetarian for example, they might not like the vegetarian options we provide. And that’s understandable, but that’s where we encourage students to reach out to us, because we’re working to improve some of our options due to the feedback we’re getting. Fountain, for example, has changed its menu based off of student preferences and the new layout allows a wider variety of options. We do have to make sure that we can support that in the kitchen with the staff and equipment we have while.</p>

        <h1>Student Interviews</h1>
        <img src="Desktop/Infographic Coding/Pictures/student interview1.jpg"
             <p>Were going to talk about your general weekly habits like your eating habits and how you eat on campus.

Usually in the mornings I have a small breakfast, maybe I’ll have a granola bar or something and then I’ll go to lunch. If I’m going to lunch, I’ll usually go to Talley or the atrium because I don’t really want to go to the dining hall, but for dinner, I go to a dining hall, usually fountain.

When you’re choosing what to eat what are your main goals in trying to decide what you’re going to eat specifically?

I guess it’s really what I’m feeling just because there’s not a lot of food options on campus, so it’s like eating the same thing, ya know, you kind of get tired of it and then sometimes it’s a choice between do I want to be healthy and not eat chick-fil-a or do I want to be unhealthy and eat chick-fil-a. 

Do you think there are enough resources on campus to help you uh stay healthy and figure out what to eat and then if you don’t think so or you do think so, how do you think it could be improved?

I think they try with the little symbols that they place on things and they tell you if it’s a vegetarian option or a gluten free option, but I don’t think there’s anything necessarily targeted at healthy eating. In the dining halls there’s  like little signs on the napkin holders that say healthy 101 and that’s really the only time I see like”healthy tips” for eating and making food.  

Are there specific times where generally you’re by yourself or with a group?

Around the day time I’m usually by myself, in between classes and stuff, but around the afternoon/night time I’m typically with people.

Okay, and then our last question is how do you try to exercise on campus like what like options do you see available on campus for people that do exercise?

There’s a lot of walking. There’s a lot of options on campus for group exercises like group fitness and stuff  where friends can go and just like cardio dance which is just dancing but ya know it’s fun and a lot of people like to go and there’s things like that.</p>

      <p>Were going to talk about your general weekly habits like your eating habits and how you eat on campus.

Sometimes I eat cereal I have in my room for breakfast, and if I’m going to eat on campus I go to Talley cause they have more vegetarian options.

You’re a vegetarian?

Yeah.

When you’re choosing what to eat what are your main goals in trying to decide what you’re going to eat specifically?

I typically just eat Los Lobos and One Earth because they have good vegetarian options.

Do you think there are enough resources on campus to help you uh stay healthy and figure out what to eat and then if you don’t think so or you do think so, how do you think it could be improved?

I mean I pay attention to the little v symbol, which means the food is vegetarian, but I don’t know what the other symbols mean.

Do you find it difficult to find vegetarian options like at dining halls specifically?

Dining halls don’t really have a lot of options, its basically salad or pizza. 

Are there specific times where generally you’re by yourself or with a group?

If I’m going to work or getting off of work I usually go by myself, which usually around 5 o’clock. 

Okay, and then our last question is how do you try to exercise on campus like what like options do you see available on campus for people that do exercise?

I walk to class and sometimes I take PE class, but I don’t usually exercise.

      <h1>Talley Student Union</h1>
      <p>Talley is one of our most popular campus food services. There is a variety of restaurants that resemble or exist as off- campus dining. These restaurants include: Jason’s Deli, Tuffys Diner, Port City Java, Red Sky Pizza, Starbucks Coffee, Los Lobos, and One Earth as well as the Talley Market, which serves as kind- of a small grocery store for students to pick up necessities or snacks if needed. They also serve our well-known campus Howling Cow icecream. Talley is in the center of campus so the location is great for anyone who lives on or near campus for a quick meal. Students regularly go here for studying, meeting up with friends, a snack, and more.</p>
